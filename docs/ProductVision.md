# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

For the UP students who worry they might forget some evaluation activity, the UniCalendar is a simple to use calendar that presents the user activities deadlines. 
Since we know that many teachers don't use the moodle's activities in a consistent way we have decided to create a shared document between students where they could add the activities/dates that they found where important for their course. Therefore this product will allow students to collaborate by maintaining a document updated with their deadlines.This will create a more complete calendar that will result in a better experience for every student in the UP community.
