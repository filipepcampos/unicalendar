# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

For the UP students who worry they might forget some evaluation activity, the UniCalendar is a simple to use calendar dashboard that presents the user all Moodle activities deadlines. Additionally, we offer the ability to filter activities and to export the schedule to major calendar apps.

This product plans to unite Moodle's activity schedule and Sigarra's exam schedule in one unique app (already implemented), providing the user with an effortless way to keep in check with occurring tasks.

## Main Features

 - Visualize a calendar with the deadlines of Moodle activities;
 - Filter which events are shown to the user;
 - Export the schedule to multiple calendar apps through an ICS file.

## Assumptions and dependencies

- Student activities from Moodle.
